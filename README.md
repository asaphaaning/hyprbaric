## Install

Install the latest verified release—no Flutter or Rust toolchain required:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asaphaaning/hyprbaric/master/install.sh | sh
```

The installer detects your distribution and uses the matching GitHub release artifact:

- Debian and Ubuntu receive the DEB package.
- Arch Linux and Manjaro receive the Pacman package.
- Fedora, RHEL, and openSUSE receive the RPM package.
- Other Linux distributions receive the AppImage.

Every download is checked against the release checksum before installation. You can also [download the latest AppImage or native package](https://github.com/asaphaaning/hyprbaric/releases/latest) yourself, or see the [installation guide](https://asaphaaning.github.io/hyprbaric/docs/installation) for pinned releases and source builds.

Start the bar with `hyprbaric`, then add `exec-once = hyprbaric` to `hyprland.conf` when you are ready to launch it with Hyprland.

## Documentation

Explore the [hyprbaric documentation site](https://asaphaaning.github.io/hyprbaric/) for configuration, shortcuts, and a closer look at the bar in action.

## Scope and requirements

hyprbaric is Linux-only and targets hyprland, with a Flutter UI, Rust backend, and a small native layer-shell shim.

Core runtime requirements are hyprland, GTK 3, GTK layer shell, Wayland, and `xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland`. Individual features can additionally use WirePlumber, NetworkManager, `grim`, `slurp`, `wf-recorder`, `hyprpicker`, `hyprsunset`, `ddcutil`, UPower, and power-profiles-daemon. See [runtime dependencies](docs/runtime-dependencies.md) for the distro package matrix and the distinction between core and optional integrations.

## Build and run from source

Install Flutter and Rust, then run the development build:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/asaphaaning/hyprbaric.git
cd hyprbaric
flutter pub get
flutter run -d linux
```

Build and run the matching release bundle:

```sh
flutter build linux --release
./build/linux/x64/release/bundle/hyprbaric
```

Release builds do not update `build/linux/x64/debug/bundle`; launching that path
runs the last debug build. The Linux build output is relocatable; consult the [installation guide](https://asaphaaning.github.io/hyprbaric/docs/installation) for package-build and hyprland autostart guidance.

## Widget catalog

The standalone `widgetbook/` Flutter app renders production widgets without
starting the bar, native layer shell, or Rust services:

```sh
cd widgetbook
flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build
flutter run -d linux
```

The same catalog can run in a browser with `flutter run -d chrome`, or on a
fixed local port with:

```sh
cd widgetbook
flutter run -d web-server --web-hostname 127.0.0.1 --web-port 3002
```

The documentation landing page embeds its interactive audio mixer and quick
controls directly from this catalog. These previews import the same production
widgets as the application through Widgetbook's local `hyprbaric` dependency.

For landing-page development, run the real Docusaurus application:

```sh
cd website
npm install
npm start -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3001
```

This creates a debug Flutter embed before Docusaurus starts, then watches the
application's `lib/` and assets plus Widgetbook's `lib/`, web shell, and
dependency manifest. Relevant changes rebuild the embed automatically, and
`flutter/previews/version.json` tells the page a complete build is in place. A
production `npm run build` performs the same integration with a release Flutter
build.

Every preview on the page is a view of one shared Flutter engine, added through
`app.addView` once `flutter_bootstrap.js` has booted, so the landing page loads
CanvasKit and the app bundle once rather than once per preview. The preview
names live in `widgetbook/lib/stories/preview_registry.dart` and are checked
against the web component by `widgetbook/test/preview_registry_test.dart`. When
the embed has not been built, the previews say so instead of showing a
placeholder indefinitely.

## Architecture

- Flutter owns rendering, interaction, and shared UI state.
- Rust owns domain state, compositor and portal integration, commands, and events.
- The native Linux host owns GTK, layer-shell setup, transparency, and native hit regions.

Each connected output receives its own Flutter view. One view is designated as
the process-global interaction host for shortcuts and setup, while satellite
views render monitor-local workspace and focused-window state. Persisted monitor
targets use Hyprland connector names; Flutter resolves those names against each
view's native geometry before configuring visibility. Rust publishes workspace
and focused-window projections together so a view never combines observations
from different compositor refreshes.

Keep raw platform data at those boundaries; internal features communicate through typed Rust and Flutter models. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the project conventions.

## Verify changes

```sh
cargo test --workspace
flutter analyze lib test
flutter test
```

## Packaging

`packaging/` contains Fastforge metadata for AppImage, DEB, RPM, and Pacman artifacts, plus an AUR-oriented `PKGBUILD` template. Run `./packaging/build-linux-packages` to build the Linux package artifacts in a prepared release environment.
